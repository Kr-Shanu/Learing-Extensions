Here in i have used the message passing technique to send message from my index.js
which is scripted in the main popup html file index.html and sent the message 
request to background.js which is the active working java script file in the 
background of the extension !!


However the experiment was successful but i couldnot see the console log of 
the index.js but was able to see the console log of the background.js.

Today i was able to add up multiple message passing in the extension and it was very successful.
I used the type of the request that i was passing and now it's done.
Further more i tried to add on multiple alarm system with the same procedure as multiple message passing.
Eventually i failed to do so as i was not able to do anything as such in it.
