Here in i have used the message passing technique to send message from my index.js
which is scripted in the main popup html file index.html and sent the message 
request to background.js which is the active working java script file in the 
background of the extension !!


However the experiment was successful but i couldnot see the console log of 
the index.js but was able to see the console log of the background.js.
